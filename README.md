# My Game DB

A simple, open source video games library manager/database. It is written in Flutter and aims to run on all major desktop platforms/OSes, however, it's only macOS-tested for the time being.

## Features

So far, only basic functionalilty has been implemented:

 - categorization based on four main statuses: 'Backlog', 'Playing', 'Finished' and 'Wishlist'
 - only manual input of data, no import supported yet
 - basic filtering is supported, filter presets can be saved as tabs
 - hierarchical structure of data: each game can have it's own 'games' - such as DLCs, add-ons or just related items
 - database import and export (JSON)

## Download
